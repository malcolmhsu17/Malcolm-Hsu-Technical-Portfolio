Both the 2008 Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 Pandemic had extreme implications on both the U.S. economy as a whole, specifically the housing market. Using California housing marketdata from Zillow and macroeconomic data collected from various sources, the aim is to examine the connection between the country-level economy and the state-level housing market. Monthly time series data will be used to reestablish the connection between macroeconomic signals and fluctuations in housing prices, fit appropriate time series models, and forecast the housing market.
