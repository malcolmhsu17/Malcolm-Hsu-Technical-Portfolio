# The goal of this paper is to assess the many components of a Major League baseball player’s resume, awards and statistics included, in order to evaluate whether their salaries reflect the strength of their statistical season and accolades. Cross sectional data from the 2023 season from Baseball Reference, including batting average (AVG), on base percentage plus slugging percentage (OPS), all-star awards, most valuable player (MVP) awards, and years in the Major Leagues, in conjunction with agent-predicted/contract salary data from the USA Today database, allows for the assessment of player salary based on their prior year and career performance. Our results may help determine whether contracts are structured based on player performance or if there are other elements, in-game or non-in-game factors, that determine a player’s salary. The number of awards won per player, while accounting for experience, has a significant impact on the player’s salary, while batting average and OPS have certain caveats.
