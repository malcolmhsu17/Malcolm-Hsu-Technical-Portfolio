# Since the pandemic, the United States has experienced a rise in the proportion of the labor force working from home, often called remote work or telework. Using the American Community Survey data from IPUMS, the aim is to examine the effect of a rise in remote work on wages among the American occupation industries. From 2018 to 2021, remote workers, on average, earned higher wages than onsite workers. However, from 2021 to 2022, changes in income for remote workers were ambiguous and industry-dependent. Yearly cross-sectional analyses and comparisons will be used to determine the initial impact of remote work on wages and will be both inclusive of and filtered by job industry. This allows for the control and examination of industrial characteristics that impact an individualâ€™s income.
