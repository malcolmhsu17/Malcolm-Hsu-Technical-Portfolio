# Malcolm Hsu Portfolio

Welcome to my technical portfolio! I am a first year master of science in business analytics candidate at Brandeis University. As an undergraduate at Wesleyan University I double majored in math and economics and was also a member of the varsity baseball team. I am extremely passionate about using predictive modeling to leverage metrics and big data to provide actionable insights for companies and their clients to enhance performance and business decisions. Moving forward, I would love to stay in sports analytics or the health and wellness industry in the Boston area.

# Research

| Project & Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [Forecasting Firearm Innovation: A Time Series Analysis of U.S. Patent Trends and Macroeconomic Influencers, 1820-2025](https://github.com/malcolmhsu17/Malcolm-Hsu-Technical-Portfolio/blob/main/Patent%20Project) | June 2025 - Present | R, Python | This project examines over two centuries of firearm innovation in the U.S. using patent data from the USPTO. Through time series modeling (Naive, ARIMA, ARIMAX, TAR) and count regressions (Poisson, Negative Binomial), I explore how wars, economic fluctuations, and government/military spending have influenced patterns of firearm innovation. Cross validation and model comparison identify TAR and ARIMAX models as the most effective at capturing long run and regime dependent behavior. A focused case study on safety arrangement patents (F41A17) highlights declining innovation in this area, with GDP, military expenditure, and arms imports emerging as key drivers. |
